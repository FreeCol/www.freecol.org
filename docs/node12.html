Game options</A>

<P>
If you decide to start a single-player game or a game server, you will
be able to choose which nation to play and which colour to use. If you
join a multi-player game, you can also choose a nation and colour, but
another players might already have selected your preferred nation. See
the chapter on your Home Country for further
information on the national advantages of various European nations.

<P>
The map generator options allow
you to import a map, and to set several parameters that influence the
size and terrain of a randomly generated map. FreeCol includes several
hand-made maps, which can be selected by clicking on the map icon.

<P>
To import a map, either select one of the maps in the shortcut panel,
enter the name of a file in the import field, or click on the browser
button in order to select a file via a file browser. You have the
choice to import terrain, bonuses, rumors and settlements. At the
moment, the map editor does not provide all these options, however.

<P>
The map generator tab allows you to select the size of the map, as
well as the amount and the general shape of the land on the map. The
terrain generator tab allows you to select the number of rivers,
mountains, lost city rumors, native settlements, forests, and bonus
tiles on the map, as well as the humidity and temperature of the
map. The latter settings will influence the terrain.

<P>
The game options proper allow you to select several parameters that
influence game play, such as non-standard rules, victory conditions
and the difficulty of the game. The initial values tab allows you to
set the amount of gold available to the players at the start of the
game. This is zero by default.

<P>
The map tab allows you to select whether to use the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Fog of
  War</SPAN>, whether to hide enemy units in settlements and carriers, and
whether to award exploration points for regions discovered by the
players. By default, exploration points are only awarded for the
discovery of the Pacific Ocean.

<P>
The colony tab allows you to enable custom houses to ignore
boycotts. This means that custom houses will be able to export
boycotted goods. This does not apply to carriers, however, and does
not prevent further boycotts by the Crown. This feature of the
original game is considered a bug by the FreeCol team and is therefore
disabled by default. You can also allow experts to ``have
connections'', which means that experts working in factory-level
buildings will be able to produce a small amount of goods even if the
necessary raw materials are not generally available. This alleged
feature of the original game is also disabled by default. Finally, you
have the choice to save production overflow, which means that new
buildings, for example, will not use up all available hammers, but
only the exact number required. The remaining hammers will remain
available for the next building project.

<P>
The victory conditions tab allows you to choose among three possible
victory conditions. The game will be won by the first player to
achieve independence, the player to eliminate all other European
players, or the player to eliminate all other human players.

<P>
Finally, the difficulty tab enables you to select a difficulty level
between very easy and very hard. The difficulty level influences
various prices and probabilites in the game, such as amount of gold
required to buy Indian land, and the probability of converting
natives.

<P>
