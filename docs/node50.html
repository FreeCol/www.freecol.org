<H1><A NAME="SECTION00720000000000000000">
Your Monarch</A>
</H1>

<P>
Your Home Country is ruled by a <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Monarch</SPAN> whose actions can
have a profound influence on your colonies and your relations to other
nations present in the New World. 

<P>
From time to time, the Monarch may decide to raise the
<A NAME="1725"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Taxes</SPAN> you pay on all goods you sell in the Home
Port. You may refuse to accept these taxes, however, in which case
your colonists will stage a protest similar to the <A NAME="1727"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Boston Tea
Party</SPAN> and throw some goods into the harbour. The Monarch will not be
amused and will <A NAME="747"></A> boycott this
type of goods. This means that you will no longer be able to trade
these goods in the Home Port until the Boycott is lifted.

<P>
You can end a Boycott by paying the outstanding tax arrears. As soon
as Jacob Fugger II joins the
Continental Congress, all Boycotts
will be lifted, but the Monarch may declare further Boycotts later
on. As soon as Peter Stuyvesant joins
the Continental Congress, you will
be able to build Custom Houses in your
colonies. The original Colonization game contained a bug which made
the Custom House ignore all Boycotts, and this behaviour is available
as a rule variant.

<P>
Naturally, the Monarch does not trust your colonists, some of which
are nothing but Petty Criminals, and some
of which even support the infamous Sons of
Liberty. For this reason, the crown maintains the
<A NAME="1729"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Royal Expeditionary Force</SPAN>, which is to put an end to
insurrections in the New World. From time to time the Monarch may
inform you that further units have been added to the Royal
Expeditionary Force, just so that you don't get any ideas.

<P>
The Monarch may also declare war on any nation present in the New
World, both European and native. This will also affect your relations
with this nation, unless Benjamin
Franklin has already been elected to the Continental Congress. In this case, the Monarch's wars do
not affect you anymore.

<P>
If you are already at war with some nation, either due to the
Monarch's actions, or your own, the crown may offer you some cheap
<A NAME="1731"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Mercenaries</SPAN>. If you agree to their price, these units will
appear at the docks in your Home Port, ready to set sail for the New
World.

<P>
