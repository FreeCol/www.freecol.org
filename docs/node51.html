<H1><A NAME="SECTION00800000000000000000">
Units</A>
</H1>

<P>
Several dozen different units are available in FreeCol, but not all
units are available to all players. Some units are available only to
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Indian Players</SPAN>, some units are only available to
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">European Players</SPAN>, and other units are available only to the
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Royal Expeditionary Force</SPAN>.

<P>
The most basic unit of the European Players (including you) is the
<A NAME="1733"></A><A NAME="1734"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Free Colonist</SPAN>. The Free Colonist is quite good at any task, but
has no special skills. At the beginning of the game, many of the
colonists will not be volunteers, but <A NAME="1736"></A><A NAME="1737"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Indentured Servant</SPAN>, or
<A NAME="1739"></A><A NAME="1740"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Petty Criminal</SPAN>, who are deported to the New World. Indentured
Servants are pretty bad at all jobs within the colony, but just like
Free Colonists, they can be sent to native villages to learn a skill
from the natives. Petty Criminals are very bad at all jobs within the
colony and can not learn anything from the natives. However, both
Indentured Servants and Petty Criminals can become Free Colonists
through Education.

<P>
Many early colonies failed due to a lack of food. In order to avoid a
similar fate, you must ensure adequate food production from the very
beginning. All your colonists can produce some amount of food,
especially on the more fertile terrain types, but the <A NAME="1742"></A><A NAME="1743"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Expert
  Farmer</SPAN> and the <A NAME="1745"></A><A NAME="1746"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Expert Fisherman</SPAN> will greatly increase your
food production. But note that the Expert Fisherman requires a
Dock to moor his boat to, and that this requires at
least one ocean tile adjacent to your colony.

<P>
Four types of units are not available in Europe because they posses
skills that can only be learned from the native population. These are
the <A NAME="1748"></A><A NAME="1749"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Master Sugar Planter</SPAN>, the <A NAME="1751"></A><A NAME="1752"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Master Cotton Planter</SPAN>, the
<A NAME="1754"></A><A NAME="1755"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Master Tobacco Planter</SPAN>, and the <A NAME="1757"></A><A NAME="1758"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Expert Fur
Trapper</SPAN>. These units are able to greatly increase your production of
Sugar, Cotton,
Tobacco, and Furs,
respectively.

<P>
In the beginning of the game, you will most likely export a great deal
of these goods to Europe, but beware, prices will drop! However, all
the raw materials of the New World can be used to produce luxury goods
that will sell for higher prices in Europe. Sugar
can be used to distill Rum,
Cotton can be used to produce
Cloth, Cigars are made from
Tobacco, and Coats are made
from Furs. All your colonists can do this, but the
<A NAME="1760"></A><A NAME="1761"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Master Distiller</SPAN>, the <A NAME="1763"></A><A NAME="1764"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Master Weaver</SPAN>, the <A NAME="1766"></A><A NAME="1767"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Master
Tobacconist</SPAN>, and the <A NAME="1769"></A><A NAME="1770"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Master Fur Trader</SPAN> are the experts who
will really rev up your production.

<P>
The New World also has two mineral resources, Ore and
Silver, to offer. Again, all your colonists are
able to mine these resources to a certain extent, but you will need
the <A NAME="1772"></A><A NAME="1773"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Expert Ore Miner</SPAN> and the <A NAME="1775"></A><A NAME="1776"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Expert SilverMiner</SPAN> to make
the most of them.

<P>
Lumber can be produced in all forested tiles, and
can also be exported to Europe, although prices are low. However, you
will need vast amounts of lumber in order to upgrade your colonies,
and no colonist is more skilled at cutting down forests than the
<A NAME="1778"></A><A NAME="1779"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Expert LumberJack</SPAN>. Nor is any colonist more skilled at turning
the lumber into buildings than the <A NAME="1781"></A><A NAME="1782"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Master Carpenter</SPAN>.

<P>
The more advanced buildings you can construct in the your colonies
require not only lumber but also Tools, which are
produced from Ore. This is the job the <A NAME="1784"></A><A NAME="1785"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Master
Blacksmith</SPAN> excels in.  Tools are also used by your <A NAME="1787"></A><A NAME="1788"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Pioneer</SPAN> to
clear forests and plow fields, but none of your other colonists can
match the outdoors skills of your <A NAME="1790"></A><A NAME="1791"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Hardy Pioneer</SPAN>. And finally,
Tools are required for the production of Muskets,
a demanding task best left to the <A NAME="1793"></A><A NAME="1794"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Master Gunsmith</SPAN>.

<P>
All your units are able to explore the New World, but the colonist
most suited to this dangerous endeavour is the <A NAME="1796"></A><A NAME="1797"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Scout</SPAN>, a mounted
colonist. A Scout may become a <A NAME="1799"></A><A NAME="1800"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Seasoned Scout</SPAN> through
experience, either by visiting
native settlements, or by investigating Lost City Rumours. The Seasoned Scout is much more skillful
at these jobs, but beware, they are dangerous!

<P>
Another colonist able to visit native settlements is the
<A NAME="1802"></A><A NAME="1803"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Missionary</SPAN>. Any colonist can be converted to a Missionary by
blessing him in a colony with a Church, or in the
Home Port, which is sure to have several
churches and maybe even a
Cathedral. Missionaries are able to establish a
Mission in the native settlement, and to convert
the natives. The <A NAME="1805"></A><A NAME="1806"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Jesuit Missionary</SPAN>, however, is much more
accomplished at the job.

<P>
The converted natives may join your colonies as <A NAME="1808"></A><A NAME="1809"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Indian
Convert</SPAN>. They are unskilled at all jobs within the colony, but more
skilled than your Free Colonists at all outdoor jobs. Indian Converts
can not be upgraded through Education, but they become Free Colonists as soon as
Bartolom&#233; de las Casas joins
the Continental Congress.

<P>
Many colonists come to the New World in search of religious
freedom. Thus, they desire a Church in which to
preach and pray. This religious freedom, which attracts more European
colonists, is represented by Crosses. Naturally,
some colonists are more eloquent and inspired than others, and the
most famous of these are known as <A NAME="1812"></A><A NAME="1813"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Firebrand Preacher</SPAN>.

<P>
While the preachers are concerned with the spiritual welfare of the
colonists, the colonists concerned with the secular welfare of their
fellow citizens meet in the Town Hall, which
generates Liberty Bells. The most dignified
and influential of these citizens are considered <A NAME="1815"></A><A NAME="1816"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Elder
Statesman</SPAN>.

<P>
Any colonist can be equipped with Muskets, which
makes him a <A NAME="1818"></A><A NAME="1819"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Soldier</SPAN>, or a <A NAME="1821"></A><A NAME="1822"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Dragoon</SPAN> if he is
mounted. However, combat-hardened <A NAME="1824"></A><A NAME="1825"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Veteran Soldier</SPAN> and
<A NAME="1827"></A><A NAME="1828"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Veteran Dragoon</SPAN> are much more effective. A dragoon that is
beaten in battle is downgraded to a soldier. A beaten soldier becomes
an unarmed colonist.

<P>
On the other hand, any soldier or dragoon that wins a battle may be
upgraded. A Petty Criminal will be upgraded to an Indentured Servant,
an Indentured Servant will be upgraded to a Free Colonist, and a Free
Colonist to a veteran unit. Veteran units may be further upgraded to
<A NAME="1830"></A><A NAME="1831"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Colonial Regular</SPAN> or <A NAME="1833"></A><A NAME="1834"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Colonial Cavalry</SPAN>, but only after the
Declaration of Independence.

<P>
<A NAME="1836"></A><A NAME="1837"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Artillery</SPAN> is most effective at attacking and defending colonies
and fortified units, but is also very vulnerable in the
open. Artillery may become damaged, which decreases its
efficiency. <A NAME="1839"></A><A NAME="1840"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Damaged Artillery</SPAN> is still quite powerful, but it
can not be repaired, and further damage will destroy it.

<P>
The <A NAME="1842"></A><A NAME="1843"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Wagon Train</SPAN>, which has to be built in one of your colonies,
can be used to transport up to 200 units of goods over land and to
trade with native settlements, and foreign colonies if Jan de Witt has joined the Continental Congress.

<P>
The <A NAME="1845"></A><A NAME="1846"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Treasure Train</SPAN> is similar to the Wagon Train, but is used
only to transport treasures. You can find these treasures in
Lost Cities, or in the ruins of native
settlements you have destroyed. If you move your Treasure Trains into
a colony with access to the sea, your Monarch
will offer to ship it to Europe for a ``reasonable fee'', unless
Hern&#225;n Cort&#233;s has joined the
Continental Congress, in which case
it will be shipped free of charge. If you have a
Galleon, however, you can take the Treasure Train
to Europe yourself.

<P>
The <A NAME="1848"></A><A NAME="1849"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Caravel</SPAN>, the <A NAME="1851"></A><A NAME="1852"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Merchantman</SPAN> and the <A NAME="1854"></A><A NAME="1855"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Galleon</SPAN> are
unarmed naval units, with two, four or six
cargo holds, respectively. A cargo hold may contain up to 100 units of
goods, or any land unit except the Treasure Train, which takes up six
cargo holds all by itself, and the Wagon Train, which can not be
transported by sea at all.

<P>
The <A NAME="1857"></A><A NAME="1858"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Privateer</SPAN> and the <A NAME="1860"></A><A NAME="1861"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Frigate</SPAN> are armed naval vessel
with two or four cargo holds, respectively. The Privateer is unique in
that it does not fly the flag of your country and can attack the
vessels of other countries with impunity. It becomes even more deadly
when Francis Drake joins the
Continental Congress.

<P>
The <A NAME="1863"></A><A NAME="1864"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Man of War</SPAN> is the most powerful naval vessel, and has six
cargo holds. At the beginning of the game, only the
Monarch has these powerful ships, but when you gain
independence you can also construct them in your colonies.

<P>
The Monarch has two types of units that you can never command,
however. These are the <A NAME="1866"></A><A NAME="1867"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">King's Regular</SPAN> and <A NAME="1869"></A><A NAME="1870"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">King's
Cavalry</SPAN>, which are roughly as powerful as your Colonial Regulars and Colonial
Cavalry.

<P>
The natives also have two types of units that you can not recruit,
namely the <A NAME="1872"></A><A NAME="1873"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Indian Brave</SPAN> and the <A NAME="1875"></A><A NAME="1876"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Indian Dragoon</SPAN>. These are
strong fighting units that can also carry up to 100 units of goods
each.
