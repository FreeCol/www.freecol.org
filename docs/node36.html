Native Settlements</A>
</H1>

<P>
The New World is by no means an uninhabited country. Various tribes of
Indians already live there, and make use of the land. When your
colonists arrive, you will have to decide whether you will attempt to
peacefully coexist with the natives, or to wipe them out. The
French player has the advantage of generating only
half the alarm among the natives. The Spanish
player has the advantage of greater military efficiency against the
natives. Your choice of Home Country may
influence your strategy -- or vice versa.

<P>
Small Native Settlements use the tile they are built on as well as all
adjacent tiles, just like your Colonies
do. Large Native Settlements also use tiles that are two moves
away. Your colonists can not use tiles that are already used by
natives. If they attempt to do so, the natives will demand some gold
for the land. You must then decide whether to pay their price, take
the land away from the by force, or to leave the land alone.
Naturally, the natives will not be pleased if you take the land away
from them. As soon as Peter Minuit has
joined the Continental Congress,
however, the natives no longer demand payment for their land.

<P>
Colonies and armed units near their settlements will alarm the natives
and poison your relations. If the natives are happy, they will come to
your colonies offering gifts. If they are unhappy, they will come and
make demands instead. If they get really angry, they may attack your
units or colonies. After a few turns, however, they will usually calm
down again.

<P>
Some types of units may enter Native Settlements. Units that carry
goods, such as Wagon Trains and
Ships, can enter the settlements and trade
with them. Trade always improves your relations with the natives. If
you offer your goods as a gift, this will improve your relations even
more.

<P>
Scouts can either ask to speak with the chief of
the tribe, or demand tribute, which is obviously not good for your
relations with the natives. If your scout speaks with the chief, you
will learn which skill this settlement teaches and which goods the
natives would prefer to acquire. Furthermore, the chief may offer you
some gold, or tell you about nearby lands. If your Scout is not a
Seasoned Scout already, he may become so.

<P>
Free Colonists and Indentured Servants may enter a settlement in order to learn
the skills of the natives. 

<P>
Missionaries, which may be either
Jesuit Missionaries or ordinary
colonists blessed as missionaries in the Home
  Port or any colony with a Church, are able to
establish a <A NAME="1583"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Mission</SPAN> or to incite the natives against another
European nation. If a Jesuit Missionary, or an ordinary colonist
blessed as a missionary is equipped with tools, muskets or horses, he
loses his missionary status and is no longer able to establish a
mission.

<P>
The presence of a Mission will reduce tension between the natives and
your colonists. In time, some of the natives may also convert and join
your colonies as Indian Converts. If the
settlement already contains the mission of another European country,
your missionary may denounce the teachings of that mission as a
heresy. If he is successful, the natives will burn down the old
mission and your missionary establishes a new one.

<P>
Note that the missionary will always remain in the settlement. He is
effectively lost to you.

<P>
