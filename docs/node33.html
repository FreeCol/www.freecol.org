<H1><A NAME="SECTION00520000000000000000">
Goods</A>
</H1>

<P>
The New World produces many goods, which can be traded in Europe. In
order to this, you must use your ships to transport them to your
Home Port. As soon as the ship arrives in
Europe, you can sell the goods, and buy others, in the
Europe Panel. Later in the game, after you
have built Custom Houses, goods can be
exported automatically. Until then, you can partially automate this
process by establishing Trade Routes.

<P>
Exporting these goods to Europe will be one of your most important
sources of income. At the beginning of the game, you will probably
want to export raw materials, such as <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Sugar</SPAN> and
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Tobacco</SPAN>, but as prices drop, you should concentrate on luxury
products, such as <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Rum</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Cigars</SPAN>, which command
higher prices.

<P>
<A NAME="1520"></A><A NAME="1521"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Food</SPAN> is the single most important good, since all your
colonists consume two units of food each turn. If this demand can not
be met, some of your colonists will starve to death.  On the other
hand, a colony that has accumulated 200 units of food will produce a
new Free Colonist. Unfortunately, buying
food in Europe is always expensive, and colonial foodstuffs fetch only
poor prices.

<P>
Food comes in two varieties, <A NAME="1523"></A><A NAME="1524"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Grain</SPAN>, which can be cultivated on
nearly all land tiles, and <A NAME="1526"></A><A NAME="1527"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Fish</SPAN>, which is produced by
ocean and lake tiles. In order to harvest the
bounty of the sea, you will need a Dock, however.

<P>
Breeding new <A NAME="1529"></A><A NAME="1530"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Horses</SPAN> also requires food, but the horses you
already have are content to eat grass and consume no more of your
precious food. In order to breed horses, you need at least two horses
in your colony (for obvious reasons). Breeding horses does not require
Stables, but Stables do speed things up.

<P>
Four raw materials are typical for the New World. They will initially
generate a good income, but prices will inevitably drop. These goods
are <A NAME="1532"></A><A NAME="1533"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Sugar</SPAN>, which is best cultivated on
Savannah tiles, <A NAME="1535"></A><A NAME="1536"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Tobacco</SPAN>, best cultivated
on Grassland, <A NAME="1538"></A><A NAME="1539"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Cotton</SPAN>, which is most
abundant on Prairie tiles, and <A NAME="1541"></A><A NAME="1542"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Furs</SPAN>,
which are available on all forested tiles, but most abundantly on
Boreal Forest and Mixed Forest tiles.

<P>
These four materials can be used to produce corresponding luxury
goods, which will fetch much higher prices in Europe. In a
distillery, <A NAME="1544"></A><A NAME="1545"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Rum</SPAN> is produced
from Sugar. Tobacco is used to make <A NAME="1547"></A><A NAME="1548"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Cigars</SPAN> in the
Tobacconist's House. The Weaver
weaves <A NAME="1550"></A><A NAME="1551"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Cloth</SPAN> from Cotton in his house, and the Fur Trader turns Furs into <A NAME="1553"></A><A NAME="1554"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Coats</SPAN> in his
house.

<P>
Initially, the resource which fetches the highest prices in Europe is
<A NAME="1556"></A><A NAME="1557"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Silver</SPAN>, which can be mined in Hills and
Mountains. As prices drop, Silver will become
less and less useful, however. On the other hand, Hills and Mountains
also produce <A NAME="1559"></A><A NAME="1560"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Ore</SPAN>, which is not in great demand in Europe, but
which can be refined to produce <A NAME="1562"></A><A NAME="1563"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Tools</SPAN> in the
Blacksmith's House. Tools are required
for clearing forests and plowing fields, as well as for constructing
advanced buildings and units. Furthermore, <A NAME="1565"></A><A NAME="1566"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Muskets</SPAN> can be
produced from Tools in the Armory.

<P>
<A NAME="1568"></A><A NAME="1569"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Lumber</SPAN> also fetches poor prices in Europe, but can be used to
produce <A NAME="1571"></A><A NAME="1572"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Hammers</SPAN> in the Carpenter's House. Hammers are required for constructing all
buildings, as well as naval units and
Wagon Trains. Hammers are ``abstract'' goods
that can neither be transported nor traded. They represent the work
required to finish a building rather than some tangible material.

<P>
The two other ``abstract'' goods are <A NAME="1574"></A><A NAME="1575"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Liberty Bells</SPAN>, which are
produced in the Town Hall, and <A NAME="1577"></A><A NAME="1578"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Crosses</SPAN>,
which are generated by the Church. They represent
the concepts of liberty and of religious freedom. Liberty Bells are
needed to convince your colonists of your policies, and to elect
Founding Fathers to the
Continental Congress, whereas
Crosses attract further colonists.

<P>
<A NAME="1580"></A><A NAME="1581"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Trade Goods</SPAN>, on the other hand, can be transported and traded,
but they can not be produced in your colonies. They are only available
in Europe and are useful for trading with native settlements, which
generally demand Trade Goods.
