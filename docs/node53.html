Skills and Education</A>
</H1>

<P>
In FreeCol, your colonists come from all walks of life. Some are
unskilled Petty Criminals, who are
deported to the colonies. Others are Indentured Servants, or Free
Colonists with moderate skills. Still others are masters of their
craft, experts at their trade or profession, who were educated at the
Royal College in Europe. If you have enough gold, you can recruit
units directly from the Royal College.

<P>
Not all skills, however, can be learned in Europe.
Sugar, Cotton and
Tobacco, as well as Furs are
apparently unknown in Europe. Thus, Master Sugar Planters, Master Cotton Planters, Master Tobacco Planters, as well as the Expert Fur Trappers, can not be recruited in Europe.

<P>
At the beginning of the game, these skills can only be learned at
Indian Settlements, or through experience. If you put a Free Colonist
to work outside of the colony for a long time without changing his
work assignment, he may learn the necessary skill and become an
expert. This does not work for the more complicated jobs within the
colony, however. 

<P>
The Schoolhouse and its upgrades, the
College and the
University, allow you to train your units
yourself by placing a skilled unit in one of these buildings.  If a
suitable student exists in the colony it will automatically appear
below the teacher in the building, as well as continuing to perform
its current task.  Note that the Master Sugar Planter, the Master
Cotton Planter, the Master Tobacco Planter, the Expert Fur Trapper,
the Master Distiller, the Master Weaver, the Master Tobacconist, the
Master Blacksmith and the Master Gunsmith all require at least a
College, while the Elder Statesman, the Firebrand
Preacher and the Jesuit Missionary even require a
University to teach their profession.

<P>
A Free Colonist can learn any skill or profession in this manner, but
Petty Criminals and Indentured Servants can not.  However, a Petty
Criminal may become an Indentured Servant, and an Indentured Servant
may become a Free Colonist through education. Any colonist placed in a
schoolhouse, college or university is able to provide this kind of
education.

<P>
Petty Criminals may also become Indentured Servants, and Indentured
Servants may also become Free Colonists by winning a battle and being
promoted. Free Colonists can be promoted to
Veteran Soldiers, and after the Declaration of Independence, these may
be promoted to Colonial Regulars.

<P>
Indian units are more productive than free colonists when working
outside of the colony, and less productive when working inside a
building. Indian units can not become free colonists through
education, but all Indian units become free colonists as soon as
Bartolom&#233; de las Casas joins
the Continental Congress.

<P>
Scouts can explore the New World and enter Indian
Settlements in order to speak with the tribal chiefs. A scout entering
an Indian Settlement may become a Seasoned
Scout through experience. A colonist investigating a Lost City Rumours may also be upgraded to a Seasoned
Scout, unless that unit already has another skill.

<P>
