The Continental Congress</A>
</H1>

<P>
As the player generates Liberty Bells,
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Founding Fathers</SPAN> are elected
to the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Continental Congress</SPAN>. The Founding Fathers are
historical figures who played a more or less important part in the
conquest of the New World. Each Founding Father grants the player a
new bonus or ability, or causes a certain event to occur, much like
the ``Wonders of the World'' in the Civilization series. At the
beginning of the game, you will need only a few Liberty Bells to elect
a Founding Father to the Continental Congress, but as the game
progresses this number may increase to many hundred Bells.

<P>
<A NAME="1879"></A><A NAME="1880"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Adam Smith</SPAN> (1723-1790), better known as the Father of Modern
Economics, penned several texts pertaining to Economic theory,
including, ``The Wealth of Nations'' his most famous text. As soon as
Adam Smith joins the Continental Congress, the player is allowed to
build factories, which produce 1.5 units of manufactured goods for
each unit of raw material consumed. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith"><IMG

<A NAME="1885"></A><A NAME="1886"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Jacob Fugger II</SPAN> (1459-1525) was an extremely wealthy German
merchant and banker who amassed a fortune with family partnerships and
stock holdings in the mining industries. As soon as Jacob Fugger joins
the Continental Congress, all Boycotts currently
in effect are dropped. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Fugger"><IMG

<A NAME="1891"></A><A NAME="1892"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Peter Minuit</SPAN> (1580-1638) bought what later became known as
Manhattan Island from Native Americans for about 60 Dutch guilders. He
later colonized the Delware Bay area as well. As soon as Peter Minuit
is elected to the Continental Congress, the Indians no longer demand
payment for their land. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Minuit"><IMG

<A NAME="1897"></A><A NAME="1898"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Peter Stuyvesant</SPAN> (1592-1672) was appointed Governor General
of the New Netherlands, which, after a British invasion he could not
stop, became New York. With the election of Peter Stuyvesant, the
construction of custom houses becomes
possible. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Stuyvesant"><IMG

<P>
<A NAME="1903"></A><A NAME="1904"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Jan de Witt</SPAN> (1625-1672) was a great Dutch statesmen.  He
represented the merchants and a encouraged industry and commerce. He
also negotiated several important treaties for the Dutch to end wars
with England. As soon as Jan de Witt is a member of the Continental
Congress, trade with foreign colonies becomes possible.

<A NAME="1909"></A><A NAME="1910"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Ferdinand Magellan</SPAN> (1480-1521) was one of the greatest
explorers to navigate the globe. Magellan was first to circumnavigate
the globe and cross the Pacific Ocean. Magellan's election to the
Continental Congress increases the movement of all naval vessels by
one, and the time to sail between Europe and the New World is
reduced. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Magellan"><IMG

<A NAME="1915"></A><A NAME="1916"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Francisco V&#225;zquez de Coronado</SPAN>
(1510-1554) was the first European explorer to see the Grand
Canyon. Though he never found the golden cities he searched for, his
mapping of the area now called the Southwestern US was important to
further exploration. As soon as Francisco de Coronado joins the
Continental Congress, all existing colonies become visible on the
map. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Vazquez_de_Coronado"><IMG

<P>
<A NAME="1921"></A><A NAME="1922"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Hernando de Soto</SPAN> (1496-1542) was the first European to
explore Florida and the southeastern US.  He also held a prominent
role in conquests of Central America. If Hernando de Soto is a member
of the Continental Congress, the exploration of Lost City Rumours always yields a positive result, and all land
units have an extended sight radius. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernando_de_Soto_(explorer)"><IMG

<A NAME="1927"></A><A NAME="1928"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Henry Hudson</SPAN> (1565-1611) was an English navigator who
explored and mapped a large area of the northeastern North American
continent.  Many waterways in that region are named in his honour. His
original goal was to find the famed Northwest Passage. The election of
Henry Hudson to the Continental Congress doubles the output of all
Fur Trappers. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hudson"><IMG

<A NAME="1933"></A><A NAME="1934"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Robert La Salle</SPAN> (1643-1687) was the first European to travel
the length of the Mississippi river, while on a mission to set up
numerous trading posts along its banks.  He later claimed the whole
basin as Louisiana in honor of the French King. Later, he explored
several of the Great Lakes. If Robert La Salle is a member of the
Continental Congress, all colonies gain a stockade as soon as their
population reaches three colonists. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_La_Salle"><IMG

<A NAME="1939"></A><A NAME="1940"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Hern&#225;n Cort&#233;s</SPAN> (1485-1547) was a famed Spanish
conquistador who overthrew the Aztec Empire and claimed Mexico for
Spain. As soon as Hern&#225;n Cort&#233;s joins the Continental Congress,
conquered native settlements always yield treasure (and in greater
abundance) and the King's galleons transport it
free of charge. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernan_Cortes"><IMG

<P>
<A NAME="1945"></A><A NAME="1946"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">George Washington</SPAN> (1732-1799) was the general who lead the
colonial army to victory over the British to gain independence for the
colonies. This victory and his leadership led to his being named the
new nation's first President. If George Washington is a member of the
Continental Congress, any soldier or dragoon who wins a combat is
automatically upgraded to the next possible
level. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington"><IMG

<A NAME="1951"></A><A NAME="1952"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Paul Revere</SPAN> (1734-1818) was the famed rider of colonial
America who mounted his horse and rode through the countryside
alerting colonists that British soldiers were coming. He was captured
during the ride and later released when his captors believed they were
in grave danger and their prisoner might slow them down. With Paul
Revere a member of the Continental Congress, a colonist automatically
takes up any stockpiled muskets and defends an otherwise undefended
colony if it is attacked. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Revere"><IMG

<A NAME="1957"></A><A NAME="1958"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Francis Drake</SPAN> (1542-1596) was a great English sea captain,
the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe and a hero in the
fights against the Spanish Armada. The presence of Francis Drake in
the Continental Congress increases the combat strength of all
Privateers by 50%. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Drake"><IMG

<P>
<A NAME="1963"></A><A NAME="1964"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">John Paul Jones</SPAN> (1741-1792) was hailed as a great sea
captain in America, and uttered the famous words "Sir, I have not yet
begun to fight" while fighting the British at sea. He later watched
his ship sink to the bottom of the ocean from the deck of a British
vessel. As soon as John Paul Jones is elected to the Continental
Congress, a Frigate is added to your colonial
navy for free. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Paul_Jones"><IMG

<A NAME="1969"></A><A NAME="1970"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Thomas Jefferson</SPAN> (1743-1826), a powerful voice of
patriotism, was credited with writing the Declaration of
Independence. He later became the 3rd President of the US. The
election of Thomas Jefferson to the Continental Congress increases
Liberty Bell production in colonies by
50%. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"><IMG

<P>
<A NAME="1975"></A><A NAME="1976"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Pocahontas</SPAN> (1595-1617) was a peacemaker between early
Jamestown settlers and the Native Americans. She is credited with
sending food and other supplies to starving colonists there during
harsh times.  She later converted to Christianity and married an
Englishman.  When Pocahontas joins the Continental Congress, all
tension levels between you and natives are removed and Indian alarm is
generated half as fast. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocahontas"><IMG

<P>
<A NAME="1981"></A><A NAME="1982"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Thomas Paine</SPAN> (1737-1809) inspired colonists with his pen at
the urging of Benjamin Franklin. He published a pamphlet, "Common
Sense", guiding the thoughts of patriots all over the colonies. The
election of Thomas Paine to the Continental Congress increases Liberty
Bell production in all your colonies by the value of the current
tax rate. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine"><IMG

<A NAME="1996"></A><A NAME="1997"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Sim&#243;n Bol&#237;var</SPAN> (1783-1830) is remembered as a great
leader in the struggle for South American independence from
Spain. Bol&#237;var freed what is now Venezuela and later became its
first President. When Sim&#243;n Bol&#237;var joins the Continental
Congress, the Sons of Liberty membership in all existing colonies is
increased by 20%. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Bolivar"><IMG

<A NAME="2005"></A><A NAME="2006"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Benjamin Franklin</SPAN> (1706-1790), a heavy contributor to the
Declaration of Independence, was one of the voices of the
Revolution. He traveled extensively between Europe and the colonies,
and gained the support of the French in the war. As soon as Benjamin
Franklin is elected to the Continental Congress, the King's foreign
wars no longer have effect on relationships in the New World, and
Europeans in the New World always offer peace in
negotiations. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin"><IMG

<A NAME="2011"></A><A NAME="2012"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">William Brewster</SPAN> (1567-1644) was the Puritan leader of the
Plymouth colony in New England. As soon as William Brewster joins the
Continental Congress, criminals or indentured servants no longer
appear on the docks and you can select which immigrant in the
recruitment pool to move to the docks. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Brewster_(Pilgrim)"><IMG

<A NAME="2017"></A><A NAME="2018"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">William Penn</SPAN> (1644-1718), a close friend of the Duke of
York, was granted the land that is mostly Pennsylvania, Delaware, and
New Jersey. He governed the Quaker colony for several years to provide
a haven to fellow Quakers. The election of William Penn increases
cross production in all colonies by 50%. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Penn"><IMG

befriended the Huron Indians and converted many to Christianity. He
died at the hands of the Iroquois who had finally defeated their

was a Spanish theologian who spoke out for the conquest of Indian
lands and forced evangelization of the natives. The election of Juan
