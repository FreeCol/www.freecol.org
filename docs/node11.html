Game setup</A>
</H2>

<P>
If you start FreeCol without command line options, the game will first
open a dialog that allows you to start a new game, to open a saved
game, to open the map editor, to set various options, and to quit.

<P>
If you decide to start a new game, you will be presented with another
dialog, which enables you to start a single-player game, to retrieve a
list of servers from <code>meta.freecol.org</code><A NAME="119"></A>,
to join a <A NAME="1412"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">multi-player game</SPAN>, or to start a new multi-player
game.

<P>
If you start a single-player game, you must decide on the number of
European players (1-8) and whether to allow additional nations (which
were not available in the original game) and whether to allow national
advantages to be selectable (in the original game, national advantages
were fixed). Of course, if you wish to have more than four European
players, you must also enable additional nations, since the original
game only made four European nations available.

<P>
If you choose to retrieve a list of running games from the metaserver,
your computer will attempt to establish a connection to
<code>meta.freecol.org</code>, port <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$3540$"></SPAN><A NAME="121"></A>. You will be
presented with a list of games, from which you can select one to
connect to. Please note that the list will frequently be empty, since
not that many public multi-player games are being run.

<P>
If you wish to join a multi-player game, you must enter the
<A NAME="1414"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">IP address</SPAN> of a server that is running a FreeCol game as
well as the port it is running on. The default port is
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$3541$"></SPAN><A NAME="123"></A>.

<P>
If you wish to start a multi-player game, then the IP address of the
server will be that of your computer, but you must still select a port
to run the server on. Again, the default port is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$3541$"></SPAN>. You must also
decide whether you want to run a public server or a private server. By
default, you start a private game, which means that the game will not
be available on the metaserver. Furthermore, you must decide on the
number of European players (see above), and whether to use national
advantages. A multi-player game may be more balanced if you do not use
them, so that all players start with the same units and abilities.

<P>
FreeCol is a client-server game. The game server takes care of the
game logic, and the client provides the graphical user interface. One
or several clients can connect to the game server via the network. In
the case of a single-player game, all other players are handled by the
game server. At the moment, however, your client uses a network
connection even if the server is running on the same computer.

<P>
This means that you can only run FreeCol if you have the necessary
privileges to bind an unprivileged port. If you use a
<A NAME="1416"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">personal firewall</SPAN> that blocks the port you wish to use, you
will need to configure your firewall accordingly. If you wish to
retrieve a list of games from the metaserver, you also need to
configure your firewall to permit connections to that server, port
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$3540$"></SPAN>. In order to connect to a server, your client also needs to
bind a port. Which port depends on the operating system you use.

<P>
If you are running a public game server, then your firewall must also
permit the clients to connect to the port of the game server.
