Your Home Country</A>
</H1>

<P>
Your <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Home Country</SPAN> is a European monarchy and colonial
power. The original game featured four playable nations, namely
<A NAME="1709"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Spain</SPAN>, <A NAME="1711"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">France</SPAN>, <A NAME="1713"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">England</SPAN> and the
<A NAME="1715"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Netherlands</SPAN><A NAME="706"></A>. FreeCol optionally adds
<A NAME="1717"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Portugal</SPAN>, <A NAME="1719"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Denmark</SPAN>, <A NAME="1721"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Sweden</SPAN> and
<A NAME="1723"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Russia</SPAN>.

<P>
Virtually all players agree that the addition of Portugal corrects a
glaring omission of the original game, but the other three European
nations are controversial. Sweden, Denmark and Russia all had colonies
or territories in the Americas, but were either minor colonial powers
or arrived very late. However, as we wished to make multi-player games
with up to eight human players possible, we had to add further
nations. We might well change the selection at some later date, and
you can change the selection by editing the rules yourself.

<P>
Each of these countries may have special abilities and different
starting units. In the original game, these abilities and units were
tied to particular nations. FreeCol, however, optionally allows you to
select your national advantage.

<P>
In the future, FreeCol will probably define eight national advantages,
so that each nation can have a different advantage. At the moment,
FreeCol only defines the following six advantages, as well as the no
advantage ``advantage'':

<P>

<UL>
<LI>No advantage: You start with two Free Colonists and a Caravel,
  and no special abilities. This is mainly intended for multi-player
  games, as it removes a potential imbalance between players.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The trade advantage: You can buy and sell twice as many goods in
  Europe before prices change. You start with two Free Colonists and a
  Merchantman.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The cooperation advantage: You generate only half as much native
  alarm as the other European nations. You start with a Free Colonist,
  a Hardy Pioneer and a Caravel.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The immigration advantage: You need to generate only two thirds
  as many crosses as the other European nations in order to attract
  new immigrants. You start with two Free Colonists and a Caravel.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The conquest advantage: You capture twice as much treasure and
  twice as many ``converts'' when destroying native settlements. You
  start with a Free Colonist, a Veteran Soldier and a Caravel.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The naval advantage: All your ships can move one tile further
  than those of other European nations. You start with two Free
  Colonists and a Merchantman.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The building advantage: Your lumberjacks produce two units of
  lumber and your carpenters produce two hammers more than those of
  other European nations. You start with an Expert Lumberjack, a
  Master Carpenter and a Caravel.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
In the original game, the Dutch had the trade advantage, the French
had the cooperation advantage, the English had the immigration
advantage and the Spanish had the conquest advantage. In FreeCol, this
is also the default, although you can optionally select different
advantages. By default, the Portuguese have the naval advantage, the
Swedish have the building advantage, the Danish have the trade
advantage and the Russians have the immigration advantage. This is
likely to change in the future, however.
