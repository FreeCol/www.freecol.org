</H2>

<P>

submenus at the left hand of the screen, as well as a status area at
the right hand of the screen. The status area displays your score, the
amount of gold you possess, your current tax rate and the current
turn.

<P>
The Game Menu allows you to:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>start a new game 
</LI>
<LI>open a savegame

<P>
The Orders Menu enables you to give orders
to the currently selected unit:

</LI>
<LI>fortify
</LI>
<LI>go to a destination you select

order is only available if the unit is able to build colonies and the
tile it is on will support a colony, for example. The unload order is
only available if the unit is carrying goods. You can unload the goods
anywhere, but if you are not in Europe or in a colony, the goods will
be lost.  You can use this feature to dump unwanted cargo<A NAME="201"></A> in order to avoid the cargo
  penalty.
