Combat</A>
</H1>

<P>
A tile can only be occupied by units of a single Player. If a unit of
another Player attempts to enter that tile, combat ensues. The combat
mechanism of FreeCol is very simple: Each unit has an attack strength
and a defence strength. Attack bonuses and defence bonuses granted by
terrain, fortifications or Founding
Fathers are added to the base values of the units. If the attack
value of the attacker is greater than the defence value of the
defender, the attacker wins. Otherwise the defender wins. If a tile is
occupied by more than one unit, the attacker will fight against the
defender with the strongest defence.

<P>
Most units that win a battle may be promoted,
and all units that lose a battle will always be captured, demoted,
damaged or destroyed. A Petty Criminal may
be promoted to an Indentured Servant,
and an Indentured Servant may be promoted to a Free Colonist. A Free Colonist may be promoted to a
Veteran Soldier, which in turn may be
promoted to a Colonial Regular, but only
after the Declaration of
  Independence.

<P>
A Dragoon that loses a battle will be demoted to a Soldier, and a
Soldier that loses a battle will be demoted to an unarmed colonist. An
unarmed colonist that loses a battle is either captured, if the
attacker is a European Player, or slaughtered, if the attacker is a
Native Player. Wagon Trains and
Treasure Trains may also be captured by a
European Player and destroyed by a Native Player. Native units that
lose a battle are always slaughtered.

<P>
Naval units and
Artillery can not be promoted. A beaten
artillery unit becomes a Damaged
Artillery, which can not be repaired and will be destroyed if it
loses another battle. Ships are either sunk or damaged when they lose
a battle. In either case all units and cargo aboard the ship are lost,
and the ship automatically returns to the nearest repair
location. This may be one of your colonies with a
Drydock or the Home Port.

<P>
The Frigate, the Man of
War and the Privateer have the ability to
capture the goods aboard an enemy ship they have bested in
battle. Naturally, they can not take more cargo than their holds will
allow.

<P>
Naval units can also attack colonies on coastal tiles, although their
chance of success is not very high. And colonies with a
Fort or Fortress will
automatically fire at enemy ships on adjacent ocean tiles.
