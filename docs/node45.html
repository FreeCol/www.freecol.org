<H1><A NAME="SECTION00620000000000000000">
Colony Buildings</A>
</H1>

<P>
A newly established colony already includes several buildings, namely
a town hall, a carpenter's house, a blacksmith's house, a
tobacconist's house, a weaver's house, a distiller's house, a fur
trader's house, and a warehouse. You can improve your colonies by
upgrading all of these buildings except the town hall, and by
constructing various new buildings. However, many buildings can only
be constructed in colonies of a certain size, or after certain
Founding Fathers have joined the
Continental Congress.

<P>
The craftsmen's houses can be upgraded to workshops, which produce
more manufactured goods. After Adam Smith has
joined the Continental Congress,
workshops can be upgraded to factories, which produce one and a half
units of manufactured goods from each unit of raw material. While the
town hall itself can not be upgraded, the production of
Liberty Bells can be boosted by
constructing a printing press and then a newspaper.

<P>
The following buildings are all present in every newly established
colony:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The <A NAME="1589"></A><A NAME="1590"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Town Hall</SPAN>, which can not be upgraded, provides
  workplaces for up to three colonists producing <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Liberty
  Bells</SPAN>. Its effect can be increased by building a
  Printing Press and a
  Newspaper.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <A NAME="1592"></A><A NAME="1593"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Carpenter's House</SPAN>, which can be upgraded to a
  <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Lumber Mill</SPAN> once the colony's population reaches 3, is used
  to convert Lumber to
  Hammers. Hammers are required to construct or
  upgrade all kinds of buildings.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <A NAME="1595"></A><A NAME="1596"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Blacksmith's House</SPAN>, which can be upgraded to a
  <A NAME="1598"></A><A NAME="1599"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Blacksmith's Workshop</SPAN>, is used to convert
  Ore to Tools. Tools are required
  to construct certain kinds of buildings and to upgrade all kinds of
  buildings. Tools are also used by Pioneers and
  to produce Muskets. Once the population of the
  colony has reached 8, the Blacksmith's Workshop can be replaced by
  <A NAME="1601"></A><A NAME="1602"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Iron Works</SPAN>, provided that Adam
  Smith has joined the Continental
  Congress.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <A NAME="1604"></A><A NAME="1605"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Tobacconist's House</SPAN>, which can be upgraded to a
  <A NAME="1607"></A><A NAME="1608"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Tobacconist's Shop</SPAN>, is used to produce
  Cigars from Tobacco.  Once
  the colony's population has reached 8, it can be further upgraded to
  a <A NAME="1610"></A><A NAME="1611"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Cigar Factory</SPAN>, provided that Adam Smith has joined the Continental Congress.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <A NAME="1613"></A><A NAME="1614"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Weaver's House</SPAN>, which can be upgraded to a
  <A NAME="1616"></A><A NAME="1617"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Weaver's Shop</SPAN>, is used to turn Cotton
  into Cloth. It can be upgraded to a
  <A NAME="1619"></A><A NAME="1620"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Textile Mill</SPAN> as soon as the population of the colony is
  at least 8 and Adam Smith has joined the
  Continental Congress.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <A NAME="1622"></A><A NAME="1623"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Distiller's House</SPAN>, which can be upgraded to a
  <A NAME="1625"></A><A NAME="1626"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Rum Distillery</SPAN>, is used to produce Rum
  from Sugar. Once Adam
  Smith has joined the Continental
  Congress and the colony's population is at least 8, the rum
  distillery can be replaced by a <A NAME="1628"></A><A NAME="1629"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Rum Factory</SPAN>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <A NAME="1631"></A><A NAME="1632"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Fur Trader's House</SPAN>, which can be upgraded to a
  <A NAME="1634"></A><A NAME="1635"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Fur Trader's Post</SPAN>, is used to produce
  Coats from Furs. Once the
  colony's population has reached 6, it can be further upgraded to a
  <A NAME="1637"></A><A NAME="1638"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Fur Factory</SPAN>, provided that Adam
  Smith has joined the Continental
  Congress.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <A NAME="1640"></A><A NAME="1641"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Depot</SPAN> stores all kinds of goods. Its initial
  capacity is 100 units of each kind of goods, but it can be upgraded
  to a <A NAME="1643"></A><A NAME="1644"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Warehouse</SPAN> with a capacity of 200 units and to a
  <A NAME="1646"></A><A NAME="1647"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Warehouse Expansion</SPAN>, which holds 300 units. No colonists
  work in the warehouse buildings.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <A NAME="1649"></A><A NAME="1650"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Chapel</SPAN> is a small religious building which
  produces only a single Cross and does not
  require a preacher. It can be upgraded to a <A NAME="1652"></A><A NAME="1653"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Church</SPAN> as
  soon as the population has reached 3 and to a <A NAME="1655"></A><A NAME="1656"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Cathedral</SPAN>
  as soon as the population reaches 8. Both the Church and the
  Cathedral may house up to three preachers. The religious freedom of
  the New World (symbolized by Crosses) causes
  increased emigration from Europe.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <A NAME="1658"></A><A NAME="1659"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Pasture</SPAN> surrounding your colony is used to breed
  horses. It can be upgraded to <A NAME="1661"></A><A NAME="1662"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Stables</SPAN>, which potentially
  double the production of Horses. Neither the
  Pasture nor the Stables need colonists to operate.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The following eight buildings are not part of your basic colony and
have to be constructed later:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>A colony with a population of at least 4 may build a
  <A NAME="1664"></A><A NAME="1665"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Schoolhouse</SPAN>, which enables some master craftsman to teach
  an unskilled colonist their trade. As soon as the population reaches
  8, it can be upgraded to a <A NAME="1667"></A><A NAME="1668"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">College</SPAN>, in which additional
  trades can be taught by two colonists. Once the population reaches
  10, the college can be replaced by a <A NAME="1670"></A><A NAME="1671"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">University</SPAN>, at which
  all trades can be taught by three colonists. See Skills and Education for details.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <A NAME="1673"></A><A NAME="1674"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Armory</SPAN> is used to produce
  Muskets from Tools. As soon
  as the population reaches 8, the armory can be upgraded to a
  <A NAME="1676"></A><A NAME="1677"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Magazine</SPAN> and then to an <A NAME="1679"></A><A NAME="1680"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Arsenal</SPAN>, provided that
  Adam Smith has joined the
  Continental Congress.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <A NAME="1682"></A><A NAME="1683"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Stockade</SPAN>, which can be constructed as soon as the
  colony's population reaches 3, protects the colonists from
  attacks. Note that a colony with a stockade can not be abandoned, it
  can only be burned to the ground by natives. The stockade can be
  upgraded to a <A NAME="1685"></A><A NAME="1686"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Fort</SPAN>, which provides better protection and
  bombards Privateers and enemy naval units on
  adjacent ocean tiles. The fort can be replaced by a
  <A NAME="1688"></A><A NAME="1689"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Fortress</SPAN> as soon as the population reaches 8.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <A NAME="1691"></A><A NAME="1692"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Dock</SPAN> allow colonists to produce
  Fish on ocean tiles adjacent to the colony. As
  soon as the population is at least 4, it can be upgraded to a
  <A NAME="1694"></A><A NAME="1695"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Drydock</SPAN>, which allows the colony to repair damaged
  ships. When the colony's population reaches 8, it can be further
  upgraded to a <A NAME="1697"></A><A NAME="1698"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Shipyard</SPAN>, which enables the colony to build
  new ships.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <A NAME="1700"></A><A NAME="1701"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Printing Press</SPAN>, which can be upgraded to a
  <A NAME="1703"></A><A NAME="1704"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Newspaper</SPAN> as soon as the population reaches 4, increases
  the colony's production of Liberty Bells.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <A NAME="1706"></A><A NAME="1707"></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Custom House</SPAN>, which can
  be built as soon as Peter Stuyvesant
  has joined the Continental
  Congress, allows the colony to export goods to Europe directly
  without the help of ships. Optionally, it may also ignore
  Boycotts.
