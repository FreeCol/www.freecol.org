The Original Colonization</A>
</H1>

<P>
The original Colonization<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization (computer game)"><IMG
  WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./wikipedia.png"
 ALT="Image wikipedia"></A> was
released in 1994 by Microprose. <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Colonization is heavily based
on Civilization</SPAN> which some consider to be the best turn-based
strategy game for the PC in the history of mankind.

<P>
In Civilization the object of the game was to build a nation that
could stand the test of times and that could also do one of the
following: conquer the world or be the first to launch a
spaceship. In Colonization things are bit different...

<P>
A Colonization game starts in 1492 and <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">the object of the game
is to colonize America</SPAN>. You begin the game with one vessel and two
colonists.

<P>
As in Civilization you need to build a powerful nation, but
fortunately in the early part of the game <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">you'll be able to
send ships back to Europe</SPAN> in order to sell the goods you've produced
or to bring back some colonists. <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Getting colonists into the
new world is a very important aspect of the game</SPAN> as one game turn
takes one year and later on even one season and as a result colonies
don't grow as rapidly as they do in Civilization. You can pay
colonists to come to the new world or you can show off with the
religious freedom of your people in which case they will hop on your
vessels for no money at all.

<P>
Another important aspect is <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">trade: the source of all income</SPAN>
(apart from Inca and Aztec gold). In a land filled with precious
resources it is important to <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">build your colonies at the right
location</SPAN> and to place craftsmen where they belong. This is not only
to have an income but also to be able to <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">live off the land</SPAN>
when you can no longer count on the support of Europe.

<P>
Through all this you'll have to decide whether or not you want to
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">live next to the native americans</SPAN> peacefully. They can teach
your colonists new skills that cannot be tought anywhere else and they
will offer you goods in case you choose to treat them as your
friends. On the other hand, their villages can be attacked and their
valuable goods can be taken from them and sold in Europe.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Other European forces are also busy occupying their piece of
the new world</SPAN>. Should their borders go too far then take over some
of their colonies by force because they wouldn't hesitate to do the
same thing to you.

<P>
The object of Colonization is to <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">declare your independence and
survive an attack of the King's forces</SPAN>. Before declaring your
independence <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">you need to have the majority of the people
behind you</SPAN>. This can be done by <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">promoting free speech</SPAN> and by
providing a strong governmental system.

<P>
