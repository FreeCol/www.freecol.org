<P>
To view a colony's panel, left click on it from the main screen. In
this panel, colonists can be assigned to cultivate tiles surrounding
the colony, to work in buildings, defend the colony against attackers
or wait outside of the colony.

<P>
The colony panel consists of several panels and control elements with
different functions. At the top of the panel, you can see a select box
displaying the name of the colony, which can be used to select a
different colony.

<P>
Below this select box, you can see the area surrounding the colony to
the left and a scroll pane displaying the buildings of the colony to
the right. You can drag and drop a unit on a tile or a building. The
tiles surrounding the colony can produce several kinds of goods,
however. If the unit is not producing the right kind of goods, you can
right click on the unit to select a different kind of work. If a tile
has a red border, then it is being used by another colony or
settlement. Please note that you can not use water tiles until you
have built docks.

<P>
As buildings can produce only one type of goods, the unit will
automatically do the right kind of work. Nonetheless, you can also
right click a unit in a building in order to assign it to a different
building.

<P>
Below the surrounding area, you can see the production panel, which
shows how much food, horses, bells and crosses your colony is
producing. It also tells you how many colonists support the Sons of
Liberty and how many support the crown.

<P>
Below the list of buildings, you can see four elements related to
the production of buildings and units. At the top left, a select box
allows you to select the building or unit you wish to build. The
button at the bottom left allows you to buy the selected building or
unit instead of building it. The two progress bars to the right show
you how many hammers and tools are required to finish the selected
building or unit, how many hammers and tools you have already
produced, how many will be produced in the next turn, and how long it
will take until all necessary goods have been produced.

<P>
Yet further below, two panels show you the ships or wagon trains in
your colony's port. If there is at least one unit present, the cargo
panel to the right will show you the cargo of the selected
carrier. Below these two panels, you can see the colony's warehouse
area. You can drag and drop goods from the warehouse to the cargo
panel and vice versa in order to load and unload your ships or wagon
trains. Press the shift key while selecting goods if you do not wish
to select all the goods present, or less than one hundred units.

<P>
You can also drag and drop units from one of the other areas
to the cargo panel of a ship.

<P>
The Warehouse can only hold a certain amount of
goods of each type. Its initial capacity is limited to 100 units of
each type of goods, but it can be increased to 300 by building two
Warehouse Expansions. If the current
limit of the warehouse is exceeded, the number of goods is printed in
red. If you do not store the excess units elsewhere, they will be lost
at the end of the turn.

<P>
If you have already built a Custom House in
the colony, you can export goods to Europe automatically. Goods marked
to be exported are printed in green. Open the warehouse dialog (see
below) in order to change export settings.

<P>
To the right of these panels you can see the units outside of your
colony. These can be fortified units defending your colony, or units
just passing through, or waiting for passage elsewhere. Right clicking
on one of these units once again allows you to give them orders. You
can also drag and drop units from and to this area.

<P>
At the bottom of the Colony Screen, you will see a row of buttons, not
all of which are always active. From left to right, these buttons will
allow you to

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Unload the active ship or wagon train
</LI>
<LI>Fill up all partially filled holds of the active ship or
wagon train
</LI>
<LI>Open the warehouse dialog in order to change the export and
warning levels for all types of goods (see below)
</LI>
<LI>Rename the colony
</LI>
<LI>Close the dialog
