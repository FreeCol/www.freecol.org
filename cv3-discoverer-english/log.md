>          ENGLAND
>          The Age of Expansion coincided with a period of
>          religious strife
>          in England. The Church of England--theoretically
>          a Protestant
>          denomination but maintaining many Catholic
>          traditions--faced a
>          series of challangers during the colonial period
>          from would-be
>          reformers, or Puritans. The English monarchy shifted
>          its
>          support between pro-Catholic and various Protestant
>          factions
>          from generation to generation, and the English Civil
>          War
>          (1640-49) resulted in the execution of Charles 1 and
>          a period of
>          Puritan rule (1649-60) under Oliver Cromwell. With so
>          much
>          religious conflict at home, the English government had
>          neither
>          the desire nor the ability to enforce religious
>          conformity in its
>          colonial possessions. The colonies became havens of
>          religious
>          freedom for groups (e.g. Puritans, Anabaptists,
>          Quakers) who
>          faced persecution in the Old World.

* FREECOL ISSUE: FreeCol 0.11.5 has the behaviour that the Unit, e.g. the Expert Farmer has to leave the Ship when in a colony. In the below screen shot: ship_movement_entering_colony_01.jpg, the Expert Farmer is in the colony where the Veteran Dragoon is fortified (i.e. by the fence, near the water).  THEREFORE: The Expert Farmer can move like any other unit on the outside of the colony.  FreeCol 0.11.5 has the behaviour of having the unit only move one (1) spot as the unit is 'inside' a hold on the Ship.

* FREECOL ISSUE: WWC1D - WHAT WOULD COL 1 DO? Movement Loss on Disarm PF#52: As shown in the screenshots, the game does not use the notion of the unit being in a cargo hold of the ship, but uses the 'free' holds to transport the unit. Unless the unit is fortified on the ship, the unit will get 'off' the ship when entering a port.  The unit can then be reselected to be in the 'state' of 'sentry' in order to get on the next ship leaving port with an empty cargo hold for the unit to board the ship.

        * Begin by buying some Horses for the Indentured Servant.
        * These show the Crown does not add tax to Horses when equipping the unit.
        * You lose money as the buy price is lower then the sell price.

        * No taxes are placed on the equipment of horses or muskets.

        * Now to check if the taxation is applied to Cargo in the Ship.
        * THEREFORE: There are no taxes placed on equipment placed on the units at the docks and then removing the said equipment (Horses, Muskets, Tools)
        * HOWEVER: If you put any Cargo, including unit equipment tax does apply if you sell it back to the crown, as it is seen as a normal transaction which includes taxation.

THEREFORE: The unit did not 'stay' on the ship and is placed in the colony of Jamestown. Not only does the ship lose all movement points when going to a port, there is no way to disarm a unit as they are not on the ship when the ship reaches a port. For the unit to stay on the Ship when it leaves port:
        * The unit needs to be Sentry(ed), and      
        * There is a free hold on the ship for the unit. As there may be many units sentried waiting for transport.

* COMMENT: This not only shows the population not keeping up to date, but also that not all colonies are set at 1, but the population at the time of scouting. The reason it seems that the colonies appear as only 1 population, is that at the time Francisco de Coronado joins the congress, the population is only 1, as the AI seems to favour having a colony of 1 when starting. IMHO.
